# Step - 5

## Changes

- Add file `/src/components/GalleryImage.vue`
- Use GalleryImage in Gallery component

## Notes

- In Vue, you have to import the component AND add it to the components object.
- The "v-for" attribute will create one component for every item in the array.
- The colon before the attribute name is short for "v-bind".  It's how you pass dynamic values.
